    <p>If you see this page, NGINX is successfully serving your HTML file.</p>
    <p>If you were expecting to see a different application, here are a few things to check:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Ensure that the <code>server_name</code> in your NGINX server block matches the domain you are accessing.</li>
        <li>Check that the location block for the path you're trying to access is properly configured to proxy requests to the correct application.</li>
        <li>Make sure that your DNS settings are correctly pointing to this server's IP address.</li>
        <li>Ensure that your port forwarding settings are correctly configured if you're accessing this server from outside your local network.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This is a diagnostic page to help you troubleshoot your NGINX configuration.</p>
